# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**generous-ledger** is a new project currently in initial setup phase.

## Current Status

This repository is newly initialized with no codebase yet. As the project develops, this file should be updated to include:

- Build, test, and lint commands
- Development setup instructions
- High-level architecture and design patterns
- Key directories and their purposes
- Domain-specific context and conventions

## Next Steps

The project structure, technology stack, and development workflow need to be established. Once these are defined, update this file accordingly to help future Claude Code instances work effectively in this repository.
